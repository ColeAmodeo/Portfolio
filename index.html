                 <p id=p1> Thank you for taking the time to check me out, my name is Cole Amodeo and I am a Jr. Freelance Web Developer just starting out on a long journey of a career.I have had a passion for computer sciences and technological design since I was a very young lad. This is my humble beginnings. Although my true passion is video game design. I have been hopelessly intrigued by both the concepts and experiences derived from video games. The general populace has previously had a negative predisposition towards video games.In recent years this stigma has been lifting as the culture of video games pushes forward into a societal norm.

                        My goal is to help champion this cause and show people that video games are not exclusively for casual entertainment. They can create dynamic E-sports arenas, forge strong relationships, and help push the boundaries of our current technologies. It took me a long time to reach this conclusion in my life,but now that I am here and motivated on my path I feel at home in a way.</p>

                    <p>
                        I began my adventure at the University of Guelph, in the Bachelor of Commerce Program with a Major in Accounting. After 3 years or so of grinding my courses out, I realized I had no passion or intrinsic motivation pushing me towards my accounting goals. So I took a year off and traveled to Australia where I worked on learning more about myself. Being a nerd at heart I've fallen back on my true passion, technological developments.
