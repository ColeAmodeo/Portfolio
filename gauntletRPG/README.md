# prototypeRPG


Started out a bit too ambitious with 3 heros, essentially trying to create a gauntlet that you have to kill every enemy to complete and move on.

If i had another 2 weeks or so I would create checkpoints in which you can make decisions to augment your character, as well as add another ability on to them. 
Creating more of a logic based game rather than pure random damage.
